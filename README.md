### variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

> first_name = "Subhaan"
> last_name = "Hussain"
> salary = 50
> travel = 3.5

### Data types

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

- Text Type:	str
- Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
- Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
- Mapping Type:	dict
- Set Types:	set, frozenset
- Boolean Type:	bool
- Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
- None Type:	NoneType
### Task

> userfname = input('Please enter your first name: ')
> userlname = input('Please enter your last name: ')
> user_dob = input('please enter your Date of birth: ')
> user_course = input('Please enter your course name: ')
> user_resident = input('Please enter if you are a uk resident or not (Yes or No): ')

> print(userfname)
> print(userlname)
> print(user_dob)
> print(user_course)
> print(user_resident)
